 * A Player is a collection of pieces

 * When making a move a Player chooses a Piece
 *  Depending on type of piece, the Player checks valid moves.
 *  Which means that validity of move is:
 *    - tightly coupled to type of piece
 *    - is a property of piece
 *
 * When thinking about valid moves, the player is aware of
 * the board location of all the pieces on the board.
